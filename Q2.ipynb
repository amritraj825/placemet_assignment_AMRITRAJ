    "We know that the mean height is 170 cm, and the standard deviation is 10 cm. Since the distribution is approximately normal and the skewness is close to zero, we can use the empirical rule (68-95-99.7 rule) for normally distributed data.\n",

    "b. To calculate the probability that the average height of a randomly selected sample of 100 individuals is greater than 175 cm, we can use the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Central Limit Theorem states that when a sample size is large enough, the distribution of sample means will be approximately normal regardless of the shape of the original population.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the population standard deviation is 10 cm, and we are sampling 100 individuals. The standard deviation of the sample means, also known as the standard error, is given by the formula: standard deviation / square root of sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard error = 10 cm / sqrt(100) = 1 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the probability, we need to convert the height of 175 cm to a z-score using the formula: z = (x - μ) / σ, where x is the value we want to convert, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "z = (175 - 170) / 1 = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we can find the probability associated with a z-score of 5, which is extremely close to 1 (almost 100%).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the probability that the average height of a randomly selected sample of 100 individuals is greater than 175 cm is approximately 100%.\n",

    "z = (185 - 170) / 10 = 1.5\n",
    "\n",
    "zscore of height of 185 cm is 1.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. the z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.05 is approximately -1.645.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the formula: z = (x - μ) / σ, we can solve for x:\n",
    "\n",
    "-1.645 = (x - 170) / 10\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving for x, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "x - 170 = -1.645 * 10\n",
