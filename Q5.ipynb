    "Since we have the information that Company A has 80% of the taxis and Company B has 20% of the taxis, we can assume that the probability of selecting a taxi from Company B is 0.2 and the probability of a taxi from Company B being late is 0.1.\n",

    "Substituting the values into Bayes' theorem:\n",
    "P(A|B) = 0.05 * 0.8 / (0.05 * 0.8 + 0.1 * 0.2)\n",

    "P(A|B) = 0.04 / (0.04 + 0.02)\n",
    "P(A|B) = 0.04 / 0.06\n",
